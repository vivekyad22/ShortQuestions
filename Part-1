# ShortQuestions
Exec

1.  execWhen referring to a command line such as Linux or Unix, exec is a BOURNE and POSIX shell command that replaces the current shell process with the command specified after exec. This command does not create a new PID. For example, if you were to run exec <command>, the shell would be replaced by that command. When that command is exited, the shell will exit.

set redirections for the program to execute or for the current shell

The >& outputfile operator is shorthand for > outputfile 2>&1.

tee is normally used to split the output of a program so that it can be both displayed and saved in a file. The command can be used to capture intermediate output before the data is altered by another command or program. The tee command reads standard input, then writes its content to standard output. It simultaneously copies the result into the specified file(s) or variables. The syntax differs depending on the command's implementation:

Find mtime , ctime , atime 
find PATH -iname "$PATTERN"
Find Last 50-100 Days Modified Files
To find all the files which are modified more than 50 days back and less than 100 days.
# find / -mtime +50 –mtime -100
Find Modified Files in Last 1 Hour
To find all the files which are modified in last 1 hour.
# find / -mmin -60

InnoDB vs MyISAM ( Referential integrity & Transactions )
---------------------------------
MYISAM ::---
MYISAM supports Table-level Locking .
MyISAM designed for need of speed .
MyISAM does not support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with MYISAM is DBMS 
MYISAM not supports transaction. You cannot commit and rollback with MYISAM. Once you issue a command it’s done.
You can use MyISAM, if the table is more static with lots of select and less update and delete.

INNODB::---
InnoDB supports Row-level Locking
InnoDB designed for maximum performance when processing high volume of data
InnoDB support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with InnoDB is RDBMS
InnoDB supports transaction. You can commit and rollback with InnoDB
