1.  execWhen referring to a command line such as Linux or Unix, exec is a BOURNE and POSIX shell command that replaces the current shell process with the command specified after exec. This command does not create a new PID. For example, if you were to run exec <command>, the shell would be replaced by that command. When that command is exited, the shell will exit.

set redirections for the program to execute or for the current shell

The >& outputfile operator is shorthand for > outputfile 2>&1.

tee is normally used to split the output of a program so that it can be both displayed and saved in a file. The command can be used to capture intermediate output before the data is altered by another command or program. The tee command reads standard input, then writes its content to standard output. It simultaneously copies the result into the specified file(s) or variables. The syntax differs depending on the command's implementation:



Find mtime , ctime , atime 
find PATH -iname "$PATTERN"
Find Last 50-100 Days Modified Files
To find all the files which are modified more than 50 days back and less than 100 days.
# find / -mtime +50 –mtime -100
Find Modified Files in Last 1 Hour
To find all the files which are modified in last 1 hour.
# find / -mmin -60

InnoDB vs MyISAM ( Referential integrity & Transactions )
---------------------------------
MYISAM ::---
MYISAM supports Table-level Locking .
MyISAM designed for need of speed .
MyISAM does not support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with MYISAM is DBMS 
MYISAM not supports transaction. You cannot commit and rollback with MYISAM. Once you issue a command it’s done.
You can use MyISAM, if the table is more static with lots of select and less update and delete.

INNODB::---
InnoDB supports Row-level Locking
InnoDB designed for maximum performance when processing high volume of data
InnoDB support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with InnoDB is RDBMS
InnoDB supports transaction. You can commit and rollback with InnoDB

To replace configuration files that have been deleted, without purging the package, you can do

sudo apt-get -o DPkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" --reinstall install apache2
To fully remove the apache2 config files, you should

sudo apt-get purge apache2
which will then let you reinstall it in the usual way with

sudo apt-get install apache2
Purge is required to remove all the config files - if you delete the config files but only remove the package, then this is remembered & missing config files are not reinstalled by default.




The tool you want is lsof, which stands for list open files.

It has a lot of options, so check the man page, but if you want to see all open files under a directory:

lsof +D /path
That will recurse through the filesystem under /path, so beware doing it on large directory trees.

Once you know which processes have files open, you can exit those apps, or kill them with the kill(1) command.
You can use lsof or fuser to indentify which is using this directory, something like this:

# lsof +D /var/www/html
